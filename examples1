  # Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors
# Throughout this course we will continue working with the Rock, Paper, Scissors. Here's the third version of the program:
# Leveraging your learnings from the notes you read (use at least one loop), write a program that does the following with a while loop:
# Randomly select Rock, Paper, Scissors for player1 and player2.
# Determine the winner using the Rock Paper Scissors function you wrote in the previous lesson on functions.
# Randomly set the variable play to True or False.
# If play is set to True, another round of Rock, Paper, Scissors should begin
# If play is set to False, "Thank you for playing!" should be output and game play should end.
